********************** Tu-154b v.3.1 *******************************************

Welcome to world of Russian Aviation!

Before use of model, you MUST read documentation: Docs/tu154eng.pdf - in English, Docs/tu154rus.pdf - in Russian. 
There are Project Tupolev docs in Docs/PT_Docs for SVN version of model. If you want to get more information about plane and PT model for MSFS sim,
you should read it.

This is a very complex model, and it's not intended for beginners.

******************************** Installation ***********************************

Unpack archive into $FGROOT/Aircraft/tu154b folder; under UNIX, you can place model into your home dir and create
symlink.

Prepare AI model; for it, copy (or create symlink) AI/Aircraft/tu154b into $FGROOT/AI/Aircraft/tu154b. 
If you skip this step, model will work yet, but when you go to multiplay mode, and another player will use Tu-154b
model, your computer will stall for long time (from 20 s to 2 min) and drop fps. To avoid this, low-poly model was created for AI/MP mode.
There are liveries support for AI models, so you will see planes of another players with right liveries (if you install theese 
liveries before).

This model intend for FlightGear version 3.0 and devel. It does not support old FlightGear version (1.9.1, 2.0 or late), and 
you would not replace FDM file. If you want use older FG version, you may download appropriate version from 
http://yurik.flightgear.ru/tu154b-release/.

For our foreign friends, Don Lavelle has create set of textures. It translate most of signes in cabin to English, take care about right terminology. 
Unpack english_pack.tar.gz and copy and replase all files to model directory.

********************************** !!! *******************************************
Under UNIX, be carefull with register of directory name. After changing main SVN server at Feb 16 2011, name of model 
directory (TU154B) has changed to (tu154b).
